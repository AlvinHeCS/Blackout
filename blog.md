conintue standard satellite movement downcasting to call method, finished movement for standard and teleporting satellite. Realised that all satellites moved so moved basic movement to abstract class.

finished list entity in range function. Wrote tests as well and everything seems to be functional including relay satellite extensions. However code is mostly in blackout controller. Need to find a better way to strucutre the code and dump them in there. Also alot of the code is very repetitive.
