Finished draft 1 of the UML for classes. Not sure if im doing it right so gonna get it checked out in tmrw's lab. Also unsure if the UMl is meant to contain if the class is gonna be
connected to an abstract class, or interface etc.

Starting of coding assignment making files and building connections. alot of groundwork has been layed out. Next time I start working need to implement Satellite so add satellite is working

conintue standard satellite movement downcasting to call method, finished movement for standard and teleporting satellite. Realised that all satellites moved so moved basic movement to abstract class.

finished list entity in range function. Wrote tests as well and everything seems to be functional including relay satellite extensions. However code is mostly in blackout controller. Need to find a better way to strucutre the code and dump them in there. Also alot of the code is very repetitive.

Forgot to add non supported devices for standdard satellite and Desktopdevices
redid the code. But the code feels really janky now (its pre messy ngl). Need some tutor advice on how to fix it.

Went to lab to get tutors help know I need to make entity class now to fix all the code in black box and make style better


13/03/24
